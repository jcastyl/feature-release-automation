## Formatting Guidelines

**Output Format:** Word document (.docx)

**Visual Structure:**
- **Headings & Subheadings:** Use bold or header styles for each feature to improve scannability
- **Whitespace:** Compact spacing - single paragraph breaks between features, avoid excessive gaps
- **Emojis:** Use 1 per feature description - simple, professional ones (âœ…, ðŸš€, ðŸ“Š, ðŸ”’, etc.)
  - Place emojis before feature descriptions, left-justified as visual anchors
- **Highlights:** Use bold to emphasize key outcomes/benefits and text before colons
- **Numbering:** Each feature's "How it works" uses 1-3 numbering (reset for each feature, not cumulative)
- **Screenshots:** MANDATORY - Include from "Files & media" column when available:
  - Extract original filenames from Notion file URLs using extract_image_filename()
  - Match filenames to local screenshot files in /Users/jcastillo/Desktop/snapshot folder using exact filename matching only
  - Embed real images from local snapshot folder using doc.add_picture()
  - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: placeholders, text references, mock content
  - REQUIRED: Only real embedded images from local snapshot folder are acceptable
  - All screenshots: Centered below feature header (6 inches wide)
  - Consistent 6-inch sizing across all screenshots for visual uniformity
  - Local snapshot folder approach eliminates authentication issues
