# Project Documentation

## Feature Release Documentation Standards

This project follows standardized feature release documentation as outlined in the Notion page "Feature release: specifications".

### Template Structure

All feature release documents should follow this structure:

1. **1-Minute Summary** - 2-3 key highlights with user impact
2. **Feature Updates** - Detailed breakdown of new features with:
   - What's new (brief description)
   - Impact (why it matters/workflow improvement)
   - How it works (step-by-step process)
3. **Behind the Scenes** - Technical improvements including:
   - Reliability improvements
   - System/Performance updates
4. **Growth Spotlight** - Community highlights including:
   - Editor of the month
   - Important milestones
   - Distillery Tips & Tricks
   - Educational resources
5. **Feedback & Support** - Contact information for user input

### Style Guidelines

All feature release communications must follow Distyl's brand voice:

- **Length**: ~150 words maximum when possible
- **Tone**: Professional yet casual, emotionally responsive
- **Brand Traits**: Human, casual, optimistic, accessible, energetic, approachable, "disruptively positive"
- **Perspective**: Always speak as "we/our" on behalf of Distyl (never third person)
- **Focus**: How features benefit customer experience and real use cases
- **Data-driven**: Base updates strictly on provided data, never speculate

### Data Source: Tracking Database

The automated feature update generator pulls data from the "Tracking Database" (Notion database within the Distillery: Improvement Tracker page).

**Database Details:**
- **Database ID**: `2702c038ca37805fb43cf18f5dde108d`
- **Data Source URL**: `collection://2772c038-ca37-802e-b11a-000bd46e0a43`
- **Location**: Embedded in [Distillery: Improvement Tracker](https://www.notion.so/2702c038ca3780628bccd98cd4dc5a26)

**Column Mapping:**
- **Title** = "What" (description of what the update accomplishes)
- **Column 1** = "Category" (determines document section placement)
  - `Feature: UX` â†’ "Feature Updates" section
  - `Feature: Code` â†’ "Behind the Scenes" section
- **Column 2** = "When" (implementation date)
- **Column 3** = "Why" (explanation of why users should care)
- **Column 5** = "Share Status" (tracking if included in previous releases)
- **Column 6** = "Release Version" (which version included this feature)

**Status**: âœ… Database accessible with full read/write permissions for automated updates

**Section Mapping:**
- **Feature Updates**: Include items with Category = "Feature: UX"
- **Behind the Scenes**: Include items with Category = "Feature: Code"
- **Growth Spotlight**: Skip this section until Growth Spotlight data source is provided

**Automation Pipeline:**
1. Query Improvement Tracker for items with empty "Share Status"
2. Group by Category for proper section placement
3. Use "What" for feature description and "Why" for impact/value
4. Auto-generate 1-Minute Summary from feature data highlights
5. Follow template structure and style guidelines
6. Mark items as shared and update Release Version after publication

**Configuration Settings:**
- **Output Format**: Word document (.docx)
- **Title Format**: "Routine Editor Newsletter" (no version numbers in title)
- **Date Display**: Centered current date below title (dynamically generated when program runs)
- **Version Numbering**: Start at 1.0, increment by 0.01 for each release (1.0 â†’ 1.01 â†’ 1.02...) - used for Notion tracking only
- **Feedback Contact**: Juan@distyl.ai
- **Item Selection**: Include ALL unshared items unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- **Summary Generation**: Auto-generate 1-Minute Summary from most impactful features

**Formatting Requirements:**
- **Emojis**: One professional emoji per feature (âœ…, ðŸš€, ðŸ“Š, ðŸ”’, etc.) before descriptions
- **Typography**: Bold headings, key outcomes, and text before colons
- **Whitespace**: Larger spacing between features; minimal spacing within feature content
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear headings and subheadings for scannability
